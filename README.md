### Who Old Are You, by David McCandless

This is a super cool and interesting data visualization called “Who Old Are You." Essentially, you put in your birthday and it places “you” in a data visualization with the ages of famous individuals and what they accomplished at that particular point in their lives.

Data visualizaition artist David McCandless gathers the ages and personal successes of hundreds of “big time” individuals or founders of companies such as Taylor Swift, Van Gogh, and Google. The visualization allows the user to see where they are in comparison to other people their age.

I think this is really interesting as far as giving me peace that my big break hasn’t happened yet. It’s very obvious from the visualization that the most successful ages for the greatest amount of people are around 27 and then 43. So I have plenty of time to have major success.

### Daily Routines, by Podio

This is another very interesting visualization. While it is not as personalized as my prior example, this visualization gives a lot of information regarding the daily lives of famous artists, writers, and musicians such as Voltaire, Maya Angelou, Beethoven, and Charles Darwin. Gathering data from Mason Curry’s book [Daily Rituals](http://masoncurrey.com/Daily-Rituals/), the site breaks down the daily scheduling of these individuals into “sleep,” "creative work,” "day job/admin," "food/leasure," "exercise," and "other.” 

When a user scrolls over each of these individual bars, more information is shown concerning exactly **how** that specific individual spends their time. I like being able to compare how I spend my time and how each of these famous artists, writers, and musicians spend theirs. I also like seeing their bedtime and wake-up times. For example,Picasso would go to sleep around 3am and wake up at 11am and immediately eat and have leisure time for three hours when he would visit friends, then he started painting around 3pm until about 2:30am. Wow!
